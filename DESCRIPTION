Package: UCSC.utils
Title: Low-level utilities to retrieve data from the UCSC Genome Browser
Description: A set of low-level utilities to retrieve data from the UCSC
	Genome Browser. Most functions in the package access the data via
	the UCSC REST API but some of them query the UCSC MySQL server
	directly. Note that the primary purpose of the package is to support
	higher-level functionalities implemented in downstream packages
	like GenomeInfoDb or txdbmaker.
